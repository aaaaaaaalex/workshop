# Create a DaemonSet for Testing Connectivity

At this point it would be helpful to have some kind
of backend to send traffic to, since it will verify
our config and topology are working correctly.

Since we will be loadbalancing across many nodes,
lets use a DaemonSet to place a HTTP server pod on every node:

```sh
kubectl apply -f -<<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: http-server
  labels:
    app: http-server
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: http-server
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: http-server
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: multitool
        image: wbitt/network-multitool
EOF
```

...and query the K8s datastore to verify our pods have been created with `kubectl get po`:

```
NAME                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
http-server-btpt2   1/1     Running   0          4m50s
http-server-vjbgx   1/1     Running   0          4m50s
http-server-xqbd7   1/1     Running   0          4m50s
```
